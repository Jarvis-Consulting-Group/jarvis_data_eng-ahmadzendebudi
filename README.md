# Ahmad Zendebudi . Jarvis Consulting

I have always been passionate about solving challenging problems and building elegant structures. That is why I pursued computer science at both the bachelor’s and master’s levels and why I am working as a software developer at Jarvis. As a software developer, I get to unleash my creativity and logical thinking to craft algorithms and systems that are efficient, modular, and clean. I love what I do, and I am always eager to learn more and improve my skills. Software development is not only my passion but also my way of connecting with others who share the same enthusiasm. I enjoy exchanging ideas and insights with fellow software developers and working closely with them on the same projects to grow our skills and work as a well-oiled machine.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-ahmadzendebudi](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-ahmadzendebudi)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-ahmadzendebudi/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Implemented an automated solution to provide Linux Cluster Administrators with information about hardware resource usage and hardware specs of every server in the cluster. The hardware specs and usage data were collected using bash scripts via commands such as `lscpu` and `vmstat`. Docker was used for spinning up a Postgres container, and SQL queries were used to design the database schema and store the retrieved data in the database.


## Highlighted Projects
**Travel Planner** [[GitHub](https://github.com/ahmadzendebudi/travel-planner)]: Designed and implemented a full stack solution for a travel planning website, where the user can select a city to see more information about the city, such as a short description of the city and the current weather. The frontend is developed using an Angular single-page application, backend is implemented with Spring Boot, and the solution is hosted using an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). The service is provisioned using Terraform.

**Hafez Expense Manager**: Developed an Android application with +20k active installs for managing and keeping a record of daily expenses, bills, incomes, and borrowing money. Implemented using Java and android native development.

**Spaced Notes** [[GitHub](https://github.com/ahmadzendebudi/SpacedNotes)]: Developed an Android application for practicing the spaced repetition technique used in the memorization and revision of study material. Implemented using Java and android native development.

**MDPI Journal Article: Designing a deep Q-Learning model with edge-level training for multi-level task offloading in edge computing networks** [[GitHub](https://github.com/ahmadzendebudi/edge_simulation1)]: Designed and Implemented an edge computing network with mobile devices receiving computing tasks at random times. Mobile devices can either process the tasks themselves or offload them to an “edge device”. This decision can be made using a deep Q- learning model where the state of the network including task loads of different devices are fed to the Q-network and the network decides to offload a task or execute it on the edge device.
