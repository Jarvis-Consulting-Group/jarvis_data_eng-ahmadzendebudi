# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I have always been passionate about solving challenging problems and building elegant structures. That is why I pursued computer science at both the bachelor’s and master’s levels and why I am working as a software developer at Jarvis. As a software developer, I get to unleash my creativity and logical thinking to craft algorithms and systems that are efficient, modular, and clean. I love what I do, and I am always eager to learn more and improve my skills. Software development is not only my passion but also my way of connecting with others who share the same enthusiasm. I enjoy exchanging ideas and insights with fellow software developers and working closely with them on the same projects to grow our skills and work as a well-oiled machine.

    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: Implemented an automated solution to provide Linux Cluster Administrators with information about hardware resource usage and hardware specs of every server in the cluster. The hardware specs and usage data were collected using bash scripts via commands such as `lscpu` and `vmstat`. Docker was used for spinning up a Postgres container, and SQL queries were used to design the database schema and store the retrieved data in the database.

    git_url: "https://github.com/ahmadzendebudi/edge_simulation1"
    description: > 
      Designed and Implemented an edge computing network with mobile devices receiving computing tasks at random times. Mobile
      devices can either process the tasks themselves or offload them to an “edge device”. This decision can be made using a deep Q-
      learning model where the state of the network including task loads of different devices are fed to the Q-network and the network
      decides to offload a task or execute it on the edge device.
