# Introduction
A number of SQL practice problems along with my proposed solution. All the solutions were tested individually and all produce the desired output. These queries can also be found in [queries.sql](./queries.sql).
## Modification to Data

##### Problem #1:
Adding a new row to `cd.facilities` with values: `facid: 9, Name: 'Spa', membercost: 20, guestcost: 30, initialoutlay: 100000, monthlymaintenance: 800`
##### Solution:
```sql
insert into cd.facilities(facid, name, membercost,
guestcost, initialoutlay, monthlymaintenance) 
values (9, 'Spa', 20, 30, 100000, 800);
```

##### Problem #2:
Adding a new row to `cd.facilities` with values: `Name: 'Spa', membercost: 20, guestcost: 30, initialoutlay: 100000, monthlymaintenance: 800`, `facid` auto generated 

##### Solution:
```sql
insert into cd.facilities(facid, name, membercost,
 guestcost, initialoutlay, monthlymaintenance) 
 values ((select max(facid) from cd.facilities) + 1,
 'Spa', 20, 30, 100000, 800)
```

##### Problem #3:
Update a row with name `Tennis Court 2` to have `initialoutlay = 10000`

```sql
update cd.facilities set initialoutlay = 10000 where name = 'Tennis Court 2'
```

---
##### Problem #4:
Update `Tennis Court 2` to have cost 10% higher than `Tennis Court 1`
##### Solution:
```sql
update cd.facilities
set membercost = f2.membercost * 1.1,
guestcost = f2.guestcost * 1.1
from (select guestcost, membercost from cd.facilities where name = 'Tennis Court 1') as f2
where name = 'Tennis Court 2'
```
